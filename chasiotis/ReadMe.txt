The files in this directory are scripts that collect data of causality index calculation for different VAR models. 

List of files in the directory:
- accMeasVAR1caus    : calculates accuracy measures of indices CGCI and RCGCI for VAR order 1 systems.
- accMeasVAR1causPCA : calculates accuracy measures of indices pcaCGCI for VAR order 1 systems.
- accMeasVAR2caus    : calculates accuracy measures of indices CGCI and RCGCI for VAR order 2 systems.
- accMeasVAR2causPCA : calculates accuracy measures of indices pcaCGCI for VAR order 2 systems.
