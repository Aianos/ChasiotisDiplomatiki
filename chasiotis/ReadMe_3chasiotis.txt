The files mentioned in this ReadMe_3 file are for measure of granger causality with the pca method

List of files in the directory:
1. main.m : a script that makes an example on a multivariete time series 
2. PCAforGranger.m : the function that reduces the size of a given multivariete time series with the PCA method
3. pcaCGCin.m : the function that computes the CGC index whith the help of PCA method 
4. pcaCGCinall : the function that computes an KxK matrix of CGC indexes of all the time series in an multivariete time series with the help PCA method
5. time_test.m : finds the average computational time of three functions (one of them is pcaCGCinall)
   
Auxiliary files:
- all the files that are mentioned in the ReadMe_1 and ReadMe_2 files
