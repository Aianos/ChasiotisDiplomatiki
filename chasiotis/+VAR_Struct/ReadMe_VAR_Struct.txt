The files in this directory are various matlab functions that create Vector Autoregressive models of different structeres 


List of files in the directory:
- SFNG : creates a Scale-free network.
- VAR1randomNG : creates stable VAR model of order 1 and Random structure. 
- VAR1RingStructure : creates stable VAR model of order 1 and Ring structure.
- VAR1SFNG : creates stable VAR model of order 1 and Scale-free structure.
- VAR1TEST : creates stable VAR model of mixed sturcture for testing.
- VAR2RingStructure : creates stable VAR model of order 2 and Ring structure.
- VAR2SFNGStructure : creates stable VAR model of order 2 and Scale-free structure.
- VAR3RingStructure : creates stable VAR model of order 3 and Ring structure.
- VAR3SFNGStructure : creates stable VAR model of order 3 and Scale-free structure.
- VARpRandom : creates stable VAR model of order p and Random structure.
- VARPstable : creates stable VAR model of order p.
