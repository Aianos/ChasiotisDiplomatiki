The files in this directory are same function that help in calculation of various measurements: 
1. Function that measures performances statistics (Sensiticity, Specificity, Mathews correlation coeffincient, F-scpre, Hamming Distance).
2. Function that creates an adjacency matrix of zeros and ones.
3. Function that make a figure of the columns of the input matrix 'xM', which is handy for making time history plors of multivariate time series.
4. Function that draws a network of weighted or binary directed connections.


List of files in the directory:
- AccuracyMeasuresAdjacency.m: This function measures performances statistics
- adjFDRmatrix.m: This function creates an adjacency matrix
- plotmts.m
- plotnetworktitle.m
